                Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife,
                Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally,
                followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death. Tony
                designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating, while
                living the lifestyle of a bon vivant.
                <br>
                Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark once he decided to consult on a weapons contract overseas in
                enemy terrain. An improvised explosive device exploded underneath Tony’s transport, and he was brought
                to the brink of death.

                <h3 class="white">Who Is Robert Downey Jr?</h3>
                <p>
                    Born in New York City on April 4, 1965, Robert Downey Jr. began acting as a young child. He made his
                    first film appearances and was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1980s, but his growing
                    success was marred by years of struggles with drug abuse. Eventually turning his life around, he earned
                    a resurgence of critical and popular acclaim, and is considered one of Hollywood's A-list actors.
