                Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife,
                Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally,
                followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death. Tony
                designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating, while
                living the lifestyle of a bon vivant.
                <br>
                Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark once he decided to consult on a weapons contract overseas in
                enemy terrain. An improvised explosive device exploded underneath Tony’s transport, and he was brought
                to the brink of death.
